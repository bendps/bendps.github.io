Welcome ! I am an ecologist mainly working on seabirds. My goal in research is to use biologging data to better understand how animals cope with rapidly changing environments and inform decision-making for conservation purposes. For that, I mainly use spatial and energetic approaches.

I started studying biology at the University of Paris-Sud (Paris-Saclay) for 2 years and then I completed my BSc and MSc at the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon.

In September 2022, I started a PhD at the Centre d'Etudes Biologiques de Chizé (CEBC, La Rochelle Université) with Marianna Chimienti, Akiko Kato, Frédéric Angelier and Yan Ropert-Coudert. I will work on the effect of environmental variations linked with global changes (e.g. sea-ice extent) on the energy landscapes (spatial variations of energy loss vs. intakes) of Adélie Penguins. Ultimately our goal is to develop predictive models of the effects of environmental variation at a fine spatial scale on the population dynamics of this sentinel specie. This project will also take me to Antarctica to participate to the population monitoring at the scientific base of Dumont D'urville in Terre Adélie.
